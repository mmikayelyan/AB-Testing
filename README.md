# AB-Testing
A/B Test of E-commerce Company Webpage
## Summary
This project conducted an A/B test to determine the impact of a food and drink banner on GloBox's e-commerce website for mobile users. The test aimed to increase revenue by analyzing the conversion rate (CR) and average revenue per user (ARPU). The results showed a statistically significant increase in the conversion rate for the test group. However, there was no significant difference in average revenue per user. It is recommended to iterate on the banner design, placement, and messaging to improve revenue per user. Further testing and analysis can provide insights for decision-making.

## Context
GloBox is an online marketplace known for fashion and decor products. To boost revenue in the food and drink category, an A/B test was conducted. The control group didn't see the banner, while the test group did.

## Results
The test group showed a statistically significant increase in the conversion rate compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference in average revenue per user. It is advised to refine the banner's design, placement, and messaging to increase its impact on revenue. Further testing and analysis can optimize the banner's effectiveness.

## Recommendation
Based on the results, GloBox should not launch the banner to all users. Instead, iterating on the banner and conducting further tests can enhance its impact on revenue per user. Segment analysis, funnel analysis, price analysis, and personalization analysis are recommended to identify improvement areas and opportunities for revenue growth.
